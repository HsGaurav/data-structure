AllocateNode->		This function creates a node and a pointer(the address is returned) which points toward it.
PrependNode->		The function creates a node in the beginning of the list and points itself as head.
AppendNode->		The function creates a node at the last of the list and its pointer points to NULL
InsertNoded->		The function created a node at nth position of the linked list and nth position is given by the user
SearchList->		The function searches the node in linked list with given id no.
PrintNode->			The function prints the nth node which is given by the user with the id, then it search the linked list with the help of above SearchList fuction and then thus print the node.
PrintList->			The fuction go node by node thus printion the linked list
DeleteFirstNode->	The function deleted the first node (ie. head node) and the head is shifted(allocated) to the next adjacent node.
DeleteLastNode->	The function deletes the last node and the pointer that was pointing towards last node is now llocated NULL value.
DeleteNthNode->		The function deletes the nth node of the linked list and the nth node is taken from the user.
ReverseList->		The function reverses the linked list and prints out the entire list.
ListUnion->			The function finds the union(the elements from two list which are both common and unique) of the linked list.
ListIntersection->	The function finds the intersection (the elements which are only common elements in the list) of the linked list.
FindMthFromLast->	The Mth element from the last is printed that means for the given value of m the linked list is searched from the last.

Difficulty->	1.SearchList function - done
				2.ListIntersection function - difficulty faced but done
				3.ListUnion function - difficulty faced but done
				2.ListIntersection function - not properly working
				3.ListUnion function - not done
